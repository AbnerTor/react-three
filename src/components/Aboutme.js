            <p className="flex ml-20 my-10 pb-15 w-1/3">Hello there, name is Abner Toribio-Vazquez, Iâ€™m an aspiring web developer. I have an AS
                Degree in Business Administration with a background in sales. I did sales among many other
                things for
                a few years, but I felt disconnected from my work, I didn't feel like I was working towards
                something
                that I was passionate about, and so in late 2020, I decided to change career paths and
                signed up for
                the coding bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill. I am still undergoing the process of learning web
                development
                but I have high hopes for what lies ahead.
