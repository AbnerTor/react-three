                <p className="flex my-10 pb-15 w-full text-white">Hello, my name is Abner Toribio-Vazquez, Iâ€™m an aspiring web developer. I have an AS
                    Degree in Business Administration with a background in sales. I did sales among many other
                    things for
                    a few years, but I felt disconnected from my work, I didn't feel like I was working towards
                    something
                    that I was passionate about, and so in late 2020, I decided to change career paths and
                    signed up for
                    the coding bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill. I am still undergoing the process of learning web
                    development
                    but I have high hopes for what lies ahead.
